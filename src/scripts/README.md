# Scripts

These scripts import from the ai_among_us package. They are the scripts that are executed to run the game.

First, start the server. This opens the possibility of client connections to host a game.

Next run client. This creates a player who requests to join the game.
Then run client again. This creates another player to join the game. 


Goal for today: create a pygame waiting room where players can join.
